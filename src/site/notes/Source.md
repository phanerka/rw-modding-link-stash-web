AKA "where tf do i look for information"

### Discord servers
❗ For the sake of convenience, every discord server channel has got both links for browser and the app (mentioned as ``| D`` ). Example:
``https://discord.com/channels/1083481230839922688/1083511643113279519`` (original link)
``discord://discord.com/channels/1083481230839922688/1083511643113279519`` (app link)
its your choice what link to use.

look for pins, dedicated channels or just search across entire server.
Main server (aka RW Main): https://discord.gg/rainworld
