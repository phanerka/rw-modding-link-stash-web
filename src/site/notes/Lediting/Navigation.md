Are you new to lediting or need a step-by-step tutorial to make a basic room? [[Lediting/Getting started\|getting started]].
Are you looking for:
- something that's important for region making? [[Lediting/Making a region TO-DOs\|Making a region TO-DOs]]
- list of mods and their documentation? [[Lediting/Useful mods list\|Useful mods list]]
- some specific object / property to add in room? Look below ‚¨á üëÅ üëÅ
- pre-devtooling specific tutorial? "How to-" folder
`(custom palette isnt pre devtooling DAMMIT)`

### Figuring out how to add specific object / property to the room
All lore-important objects are described in "How to add X in the mod".
Talking bout the rest stuff, there are 4 possible ways how that could be done:
- via DevTools (non-static objects, effects, 0g, music, adding conditions)
If you have access to it in game: enable dev tools in the room and check Objects and Properties tabs
If you have no access: check devtools page and [[Lediting/Useful mods list#Dependencies\|libraries' docs]]
- via [[Lediting/Making a region TO-DOs#properties.txt\|region properties]] (recoloring creatures, setting amount of creatures)
- with [[Lediting/How to-/create custom palette\|custom palettes]] (recoloring pipes / sky, room-wide color manipulation)
- in very rare cases, its configured via code (like progress bar for gates)

If you're looking for hacky stuff, check "Fancy lediting tricks" folder.
