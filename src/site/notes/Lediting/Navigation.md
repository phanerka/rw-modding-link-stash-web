Are you new to lediting or need a step-by-step tutorial to make a basic room? [[Lediting/Getting started\|getting started]].
Are you looking for:
- something that's important for region making? [[Lediting/Making a region TO-DOs\|Making a region TO-DOs]]
- list of mods and their documentation? [[Lediting/Useful mods list\|Useful mods list]]
- some specific object / property to add in room? Look below ‚¨á üëÅ üëÅ
- pre-devtooling specific tutorial? "How to-" folder
`(custom palette isnt pre devtooling DAMMIT)`

### Figuring out how to add specific object / property to the room
honestly, just ask in any server lmao
but...

All lore-important objects are described in "How to add X in the mod".
Talking bout the rest stuff, there are 4 possible ways how that could be done:
- via DevTools
	- If you have access to the room with what you want in game:
		enable DevTools, enter the room and check Objects and Properties tabs
	- If you don't:
		- check DevTools [wiki page](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Dev_Tools#Interface_Tabs) and search what you need in "Objects" and "Room Settings" tabs via `Ctrl + F`
		- check [[Lediting/Useful mods list#Dependencies\|libraries' docs]]
- via [[Lediting/Making a region TO-DOs#properties.txt\|region properties]] (recoloring creatures, setting amount of creatures)
- with [[Lediting/How to-/create custom palette\|custom palettes]] (recoloring pipes / sky, room-wide color manipulation)
- in very rare cases, its configured via code (like progress bar for gates)

If you're looking for hacky stuff, check "Fancy lediting tricks" folder.
