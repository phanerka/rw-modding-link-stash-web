> [!warning] That's not entire list. Some mods are more niche and mentioned in "How-to"s

Must-haves:
- Dev Tools: a classic. you cannot finish a room without devtools. literally.
For Dev Tools plugins, check [[Coding/Useful mods list\|coding section]]. 
- [Custom Region Support](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2941565790) ([docs](https://github.com/Garrakx/Custom-Regions)): aside from providing features to make a decent region (custom pearls, threat music, landscape art), adds a separate log which helps with determining errors. 
- [Warp Menu](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920446893) ([Wiki page](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Warp)): teleports to any room in game. Unless you modify connections to existing rooms, you will have no way to access the one you just added in the game.

Recommended:
- [Better Decals](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3241776574): allows decals to be more customized. 
- [Freezing cycle](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3035801552): helps to edit the room in Dev Tools without worries that rain will eventually come. More info in [[Lediting/Tips#Rain disable\|üëç Tips]]
- [Room Screenshot](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3125783486): self-explanatory.
- [Palette Creator](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2959458351): cool thing but broken, unfortunately. Refer "[[Lediting/How to-/create custom palette\|create custom palette]]" file for working one.
- [Region Acronym Complete Fix](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3412393061): allows to use more than 2 letters for [[Lediting/I wanna make new region!#Region naming\|acronym]].
- [Region Title Fix](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2998885818): TODO to be added

Dependencies:
- [RegionKit](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920439476) ([features](https://github.com/Rain-World-Modding/RegionKit/blob/main/README.md), [docs](https://github.com/Rain-World-Modding/RegionKit/tree/main/docs)): a "unified dependency and object kit"; provides a lot of various features, starting with more room customization and ending with more devtools objects. 
- [Lunacy](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2930814260) ([docs](https://github.com/Nacu0021/Lunacy)): yet another feature library. 
- [The M4rbelous Entity Pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3311812030): new creatures and items pack. 
TODO: should i mention other item/creature mods here or just list to steam workshop?
or actually... just make foldable list?
- [Coloured Lanterns](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3401635588):  self explanatory.
