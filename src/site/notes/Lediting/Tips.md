### Lediting tips
> [!warning] Disclaimer
> this ass (yes, the person whose scribbles you're reading) has _never_ made a single own room, so please don't take what i'm saying seriously. i just... uh... like to check out others rooms. also, i read mod design channel and analyzed Solar's outskirts room reworks for a bit.

> [!warning] These tips are general! Think of them as "things to consider" than "rules needed to follow". 

- don't underestimate diagonal tiles for map form
- don't make path _too_ straightforward
- give alternative ways to evade enemies
- remember that it's post-apocalypse world (nothing looks perfect, there are trash piles, broken parts, etc.)
- don't let objects fly in air for no reason
- be creative! Feel free to use some props not according to their name.
Who'd guess that "90% of the world's tank holders are not, in fact, holding tanks" (source: [RW Main](https://discord.com/channels/291184728944410624/1094742804627980308/1308840579643215932))?
And look at this peculiar way of using small pipe tiles:

- don't make background or room boundaries *too* distracting unless it's intended
- make sure you can visually differentiate foreground from background (grayscaling the room might help)
- learn, study rooms made [[Lediting/For inspiration#Community-made rooms\|by other people]], study in-game rooms, what tiles are usually used where and in pair with what (btw most commonly used: black goo (note it doesn't draw over all tiles!), slime, smth else i forgor)
- consistency! in general, a room looks better if you use ~same tiles on different room layers. if u're making a region, gotta decide with set of tiles n props ure gonna use
- try applying dead & alive plant effects at the same spot

##### Region making
Okay these tips are somewhat important because some stuff might make your region annoying / exhausting to explore / impossible without checking region map.
- proper shelter & food distribution
- no chokepoint rooms (required to pass to reach another gate) if possible
- no unobvious 2 screen high rooms
- shit camera transition
- too many enemies in a given area
- overuse of mandatory parkour (esp above death pits.)
- annoying to navigate (?)
- no overcluttering visibility
