### Things to download
- level editor: [link to a list of them](https://seroen.github.io/Seroens-Repo/info.html)
It explains differences between editors pretty well. Personally I use **Rained** ([manual](https://pkhead.github.io/rained/en/)). It has got good balance between "good UI" and "up-to-date". 
- preview of lediting features (tiles, props, effects):
    - [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1mDhiQAi7CHkGy0Fd6Oi0s8tOZr7H152-) (source: [RWMA](https://discord.com/channels/1083481230839922688/1083506128010358915/1210363538397331567))
    - updated list of effect previews (source: [RW Main](https://discord.com/channels/291184728944410624/838185248981385256/1322828255190843412))
- (optional) example mod [zip file link from discord](https://nqywadcmwusjqlrg.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/notes/files/lediting/regionTemplate-uSyLk5ZX5XkDsNsaUn9NeCVu0Gz1lf.zip) (source: [RWMA](https://discord.com/channels/1083481230839922688/1083506128010358915/1268631425532563496)) #templates
### Things to learn
General suggestion is to explore original game rooms and get acknowledged with what materials are used, what materials go well, etc.
- https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Architecture_of_Rain_World

### Useful links
- Seroen's Warehouse 
https://seroen.github.io/Seroens-Repo/index.html
Very good repo. It has got a lot of links and files that would come in handy. Have to admit, a lot of stuff has been pulled from there.
