### Things to download
- level editor: [link to a list of them](https://seroen.github.io/Seroens-Repo/info.html)
It explains differences between editors pretty well. Personally I use **Rained** ([manual](https://pkhead.github.io/rained/en/)). It has got good balance between "good UI" and "up-to-date". 
General level editor guide: [Wiki page](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Level_Editor)
- preview of lediting features (tiles, props, effects):

### Things to learn
General suggestion is to explore original game rooms and get acknowledged with what materials are used, what materials go well, etc.

### Useful links
- Seroen's Warehouse: [linky link](https://seroen.github.io/Seroens-Repo/index.html)
Very good repo. It has got a lot of links and files that would come in handy. Have to admit, a lot of stuff has been pulled from there.


!! NOTE: for some reason, new regions aren't friendly with debug world.
