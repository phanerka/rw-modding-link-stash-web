(is it still valid?)
alright, it all depends on the red line in the camera editor
72Ã—43 is the size of 1 camera, and 1 screen rooms
to get the right amount of overlap in multi-screen rooms, you need to make sure the camera's red borders touch
camera's red border is 52Ã—43
so, for the x axis 72 (the basic size for 1 screen) + (52 (the size of the red camera border for multi-screen rooms) Ã— one less the number of horizontal screens you want)
then, for the y axis it's 43 Ã— the number of screens you want (edited)
when im referring to the red line, i mean the little red border on the inside of the camera
