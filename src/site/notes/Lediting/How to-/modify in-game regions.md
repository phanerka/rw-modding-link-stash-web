Unless you want to straight up replace some file from the game (wiki page is [here](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Downpour_Reference/Mod_Directories#Overwriting_Files)), you'll likely need to use modification syntax. It will help with cross-mod compatibility.

Region project files are located in the Warehouse. Render them manually and put in the folder n stuff 

> [!note] Some level editors like Rained supply with region projects by default.
