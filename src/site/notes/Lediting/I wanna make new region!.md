Once you're confident with them, you'll need to request access the document and add own values. 


if you ever decide to change region name during development, [this](https://github.com/glebi574/rw-fix-region-acronyms) might help you to do it quickly.

Recently, a [mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3412393061) was released that allows to use more than 2 letters for acronym. Yay!
### Post-release to-do
When you finish the region, you'll likely want its map to be shared.

Check this and reach out Alduris to post your region map. 

##### Map exporter beta
> Makes interactive maps. The interface is in the remix menu. Instructions are included there, but here's the general gist of things:
> 1. Run the screenshotter for the regions/slugcats of your choice.
> 2. Use the editor to edit the map in case of overlapping or unpositioned rooms. The map takes from the dev view map in dev tools, NOT the canon view (in-game map).
> 3. Run the generator to turn the map into tiles.
> 4. Run the local server in the export tab to view it in-browser. The export feature is not done yet.
> 
> Permalink to download the latest version of the beta: https://github.com/alduris/MapExporter/releases/latest
> If you receive an error or the screenshotter stops running without closing, please upload LogOutput.log, LogOutput.log.1, and, if it exists, exceptionLog.txt
