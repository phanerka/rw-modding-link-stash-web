Debugging is closely tied to [[Exploring contents/Base game & Downpour/Technical files#Logs\|logs]] and [[Exploring contents/Base game & Downpour/Code\|base code]] inspection: make sure to do it as well. 

hopefully u downloaded [[Coding/Getting started#Setting up RW for debugging\|everything]] you needed for it.


to debug your own mod in dnspy, you gotta use the one that lies in mods folder. u have to replace it every time after build!
to debug others mods: 
`Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\312520`

gotta add vids vids vids
how to use dnspy vid?
