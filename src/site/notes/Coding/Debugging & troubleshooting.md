Debugging is closely tied to [[Exploring contents/Base game & Downpour/Technical files#Logs\|logs]] and [[Exploring contents/Base game & Downpour/Code\|base code]] inspection: make sure to do it as well. 

hopefully u downloaded [[Coding/Getting started#Setting up RW for debugging\|everything]] you needed for it.

### Setting up
to debug your own mod in dnspy, you gotta use the one that lies in mods folder. 

> [!warning] Don't forget to replace it every time after build!

to debug others mods: 
`Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\312520`

### Attaching
If attaching doesn't work, try
- disabling all mods (clean `enabledMods.txt` file and `mergedMods` folder)
- disabling all network drivers (VPN, local network) except the one that provides internet connection
- ??? https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/managed-code-debugging.html
