### Prerequisites
You need a unity with same version of rain world (i forgor TODO)

imma put unfinished cool shader here and pretend its supposed to be here

Explanation: 
> First we must understand how rain world knows how to draw rain. In vanilla, at room init, it makes a 'mask' texture the size of the level, basically going through every column and painting red, until it finds a solid block, then paints the rest black. Then in the shader it doesnt draw rain anywhere where it's black. So here was the plan: Redraw said mask texture but with an angle to it. Lets begin:
> 
> 1. Make a texture twice the size of the level
> 2. Go through every piece of geometry and paint four black pixels on the texture (because its upscaled)
> 3. Add a pixel in the corner of two solid pieces of geometry (this is so it looks less blocky)
> 4. Start in the bottom left corner of the image and move down x pixels (x is based on the angle) and right 1 pixel. If it is not black, dont do anything, but if it is black, paint the rest of the pixels on that path black.
> 5. Move up x pixels and repeat.
> 6. Once you reach upper oob, stop, and continue the process but moving right each time, instead of up.
> 
> After this, I just clear the mask texture and replace it with the new one. Then for the actual rain angle I just change rainDirectionGetTo to whatever the new angle is

> For some background, Futile is a bit of a frankenstein's monster when it comes to iteroperability with base Unity systems; while Unity shaders work, the behavior is overshadowed by Futile's layer system. This caused me to spend more hours than I care to admit trying to figure out why an unlit holographic/additive shader I wrote was casting shadows. It was pretty terrible to deal with.
