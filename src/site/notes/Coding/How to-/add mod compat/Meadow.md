idk ðŸ˜” TBA
but hey, check [\#playtesting -> Mod Porting](https://discord.com/channels/1094716194180841602/1326036277488914523) thread in Rain Meadow server for help (invite link is in [Github repo](https://github.com/henpemaz/Rain-Meadow))

### How Meadow networking workie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_WsvZAkFZI

### Setting up environment
https://github.com/henpemaz/Rain-Meadow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

##### Configuration builds
- ArenaP2P - local build with Arena mode available only (e.g. even if you try to host Story, Arena will be run instean) 
- Debug - Steam debug build. 
- FreeRoamP2P - local build with Free Roam mode available only.
There was a mode called "Free Roam" which synced nothing but slugcats and environment (rain, food pips, etc.). While it was the first mode that was working (sort of), it wasn't touched for a while, therefore becoming the buggiest of all. Now FreeRoam is hidden in mode select list, and picking it isn't advisable.
- LocalP2P - local build with Meadow? mode available only
- Release - Steam release build. (cannot be debugged, unlike debug?)
- StoryP2P - local build with Story mode available only

P2P suffix means it's a **local build**, intended for testing networking at single desktop. Game instance that is going to host has to be run via Steam, while clients are meant to be launched directly from executable (`Rain World\RainWorld.exe`)

### Debugging
Logs: uses [[Exploring contents/Base game & Downpour/Technical files#LogOutput log\|logOutput.log]].

There's in-built support for `start screen:0` setting for [[Exploring contents/Cheat codes\|setup.txt]] which automatically starts up lobby
can't automatically join however 

Debug info for connections (connected user id, ping) can be found by opening Dev Tools.
##### Packet loss and delay (ping) simulation
Local builds have it enabled by default.
To configure it (or completely disable by setting ``simulatedLoss`` and ``simulatedLatency`` to ``0``), check `Online\Matchmaking\UdpPeer.cs`

### Public hidden testing
Meadow shows lobbies **only** with same meadow mod version installed.
To hide all other lobbies for you (and make yours hidden for others at the same time), change `MeadowVersionStr` variable in `RainMeadow.cs` to some another value.
Make sure to share your modified version build with your playtesters!

### Meadow mode vibe zones
Spreadsheet with music distribution in base regions:

    - room name that will be vibe zone
	- minimum radius of vibe zone
	- maximum radius of vibe zone
