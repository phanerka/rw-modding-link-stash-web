(basically you'll need to follow [this](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Code_Environments) tutorial)
### Things to know
C# my ass
Useful concepts (you can learn them later):
- [[Coding/How to-/(technically)/modify game logic\|Hooking / IL hooking]] (to modify base game logic)
- [[Coding/How to-/(technically)/store data for existing objects\|ConditionalWeakTables]] (to store data)
- [[Coding/How to-/add a creature or item\|EnumExt]] (to register new objects)
### Things to download
- IDE for C#

If you're planning to [[Coding/How to-/add new shader\|make shaders]] or make Debug version of RW yourself (there's a download link, but *what if!*), you'll have to download [[Exploring contents/Unity version\|specific version]] of Unity. It's very bulky, make sure to do it beforehand!
#### Setting up RW for debugging
> [!info] Disclaimer
> It's your choice whether you want to do it or not.
 > 
> Personally I advise to set up it up. If you learn how to use DNSpy features, it will massively help you to identify bugs and explore game code.
> But Debug World is proven to be problematic with *any* enabled mod that has custom region and sometimes is hard to attach to.

- Debug world versions of Rain World
	- the [one](https://nqywadcmwusjqlrg.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/notes/files/coding/DebugWorld-rvrKbEeqowXM2GOMBub4GDKEjJfkuZ.zip) from \#modding-resources channel. Note that has modified `Assembly-CSharp.dll` file, which causes all mods to be verified by mod version, not checksum. Also, it doesn't work with Meadow.
	- another one made by stupid me who likes to do things the hard way. Oh well. At least I put some additional info in there. 
	Just unzip the files and replace them in RW game folder.
	If the game breaks on start: delete `Rain World\BepInEx\config\BepInEx.cfg` and restart the game.
	If the game breaks on loading: some room that is added by *any* enabled mod wasn't baked properly. Refer to [[Lediting/Making a region TO-DOs#Region baking\|this]] for proper baking instructions.
