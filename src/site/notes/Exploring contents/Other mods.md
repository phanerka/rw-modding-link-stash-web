To look up for open source mods, easiest solution is to open RW Workshop page and search by "github" ([hey look, i did it for ya](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=312520&searchtext=github))

Workshop mods location: 
`Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\312520`
You can debug them just like [[Coding/Debugging & troubleshooting\|your own mod]]. 

To find technical files e.g. saves created by other mods (except [[Exploring contents/Base game & Downpour/Technical files#CustomRegionsSupport log crs\|CRS]] since it's a must-have for general lediting), check "Coding" -> "How to-" -> "add mod compat" [[Coding/How to-/add mod compat/Meadow\|folder]].
