To look up for open source mods, easiest solution is to open RW Workshop page and search by "github" ([hey look, i did it for ya](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=312520&searchtext=github))

Workshop mods location: 
`Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\312520`
You can debug them just like [[Coding/Debugging & troubleshooting\|your own mod]]. 

Downloading mods w/o workshop: 
[RainDB](https://andrewfm.github.io/RainDB/index.html)
