``istg if anything will be requested to delete from this repo ill call it "censored edition"``

If I stop maintaining this repo, I allow anyone to fork it and post it somewhere. I don't even care if I'll be credited or not. Genuinely. 
Just keep following others' rules, please. Don't be a dick.


\[CREDITING]
I credited people here:
 - whose guides/words were copied due to info in Discord servers being not very easy to access
 - who weren't directly credited neither had source link to their message

However, if you're not happy with your info being added here / want to be credited separately, still / I forgot to credit you, reach me out. We'll figure things out.
