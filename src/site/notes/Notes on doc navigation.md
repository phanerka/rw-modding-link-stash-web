### Discord server links
For the sake of convenience, every discord server channel has got both links for browser and the app (mentioned as ``| D`` ). Example:
``https://discord.com/channels/1083481230839922688/1083511643113279519`` (original link)
``discord://discord.com/channels/1083481230839922688/1083511643113279519`` (app link)
it's your choice what link to use.
