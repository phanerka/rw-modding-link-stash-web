- Try avoiding duplicating information. If you have to use in same places, decide where it's more important, and put a link to it on second spot.
- ALL info regarding in-game code logic / files / "how to pull out files" goes into "Exploring contents" folder. If it's available online, put into respective "References" file instead.
- Some information is better that no information. If your doc isn't finished yet, that's alright.
- I'm not collecting info regarding pre-v1.9 modding. No. I don't want to confuse people with pages for another version of the game. Neither I'm interested in taking care of it, to be honest.
- Please *always* add a source where you found the guide / file. I'm not accepting it otherwise.
