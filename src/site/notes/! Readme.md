\[WIP] An attempt to gather all useful info regarding RW modding in one spot, organized and intended to be easily found.

Note that it won't tell "how to draw" or "how to code". That stuff is up to you.

### Disclaimer

2 notes.
I'm a noob in modding, and I had no idea where to start. Moreover, I'm the type of person who asks for help as very last resort. This doc was made by myself for *myself* in the first place, to get a better understanding of modding process in general. 
But it doesn't mean I got everything right. 

For more experienced modders: if I got a lot of things wrong, I'm sorry. 
For those who's messages were referenced here and are annoyed I didn't ask them first: I'm also sorry. I'm anxious. 
Contact infos are mentioned in [[Credits n legal stuff\|credits]]. 
In worst case, I'll just delete this repo and stick with offline version. That's all.

Contributions are welcome, of course. 

And second note: I wanted to release the repo in finished state but I'm just getting tired of editing. Most of job left is to just check if old apps are working and viable. 
### The motives
During document creation, I started to concern if it's actually useful. Yeah, its possible to google and search across servers.
But then I asked these questions: 
- What if you're banned in main server for whatever reason and thus dont have access to the files? 
- You might think you're doing fine but apparently you couldn't even guess that some tool exists which would make your life much *much* easier. I started with checking wiki myself and didn't know a thing that debugging files exist....      
- When you're starting off, you know *nothing*. What exists, what could be useful, etc. A single wiki page isn't enough, unfortunately. 
- Sometimes... you might just not know how to phrase better when you're looking for something. 

And if you're anxious as much as me and think "Well, that is probably a well known fact and people would be annoyed for asking... ", here's my advice: 

No, go do it. There's no systematization of gathered links, created utilities, there's no guide how to make something *from start to finish*.
Some wiki pages duplicate same information, some pages are not referenced anywhere so you have to *know* about their existence first...
And finally, I think that Helpers would actually *love* to help you with basic problems.

Anyway.... hopefully it will save your time and braincells and give a basic vision of what you need to complete a certain task. 

Enjoy.
