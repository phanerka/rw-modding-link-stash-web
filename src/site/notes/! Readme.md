Heyo and welcome to WIP link stash! Please enjoy your stay ʕ●.●ʔ

Before you start with anything, please check navigation links. It might help with searching for what you need!




Entire documentation is made with Obsidian. If you want to have it offline, then sure, get the vault here! TODO
### Disclaimers
This website WON'T:
 - replace official modding wiki. Instead, it directs to appropriate wiki pages and adds remarks (from personal notes or messages i read in the servers), if such haven't been found there
 - even try to hide any kinds of game spoilers. *You've been warned.*
 - provide "step by step" exhaustive guides.
 - explain vague and non-RW related topics like "how to draw" or "how to code". That stuff is up to you.
 - have any information regarding v1.5 modding. And it's not planned to to be added. The doc MAY contain some v1.5 guides but ONLY if they still provide some useful information for v1.9 modding.

And.. my personal note. I'll leave it here for some time. Maybe will delete later.
I'm.... actually a newbie in modding. I just had no idea where to start. Moreover, I'm the type of person who asks for help as very last resort. This doc was made by myself for *myself* in the first place, to get a better understanding of modding process in general. For some reason... i decided to put some effort into verifying information and making everything look clean.
But it doesn't mean I got everything right. 

For more experienced modders: if I got a lot of things wrong, I'm sorry. 
For those who's messages were referenced here and are annoyed I didn't ask them first: I'm also sorry. I'm anxious. 
Contact infos are mentioned in [[Credits n legal stuff\|credits]]. 
In worst case, I'll just delete this repo and stick with offline version. That's all. And i'll be fine with that.

Contributions are welcome, of course. 



Anyway,
	enjoy.
