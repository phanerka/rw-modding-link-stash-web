\[WIP] An attempt to gather all useful info regarding RW modding in one spot, organized and intended to be easily found.

Note that it won't:
 - provide "step by step" exhaustive guide. It just provides what's accessible in the public.
 - tell "how to draw" or "how to code". That stuff is up to you.

### Disclaimer

2 notes.
I'm a noob in modding, and I had no idea where to start. Moreover, I'm the type of person who asks for help as very last resort. This doc was made by myself for *myself* in the first place, to get a better understanding of modding process in general. 
But it doesn't mean I got everything right. 

For more experienced modders: if I got a lot of things wrong, I'm sorry. 
For those who's messages were referenced here and are annoyed I didn't ask them first: I'm also sorry. I'm anxious. 
Contact infos are mentioned in [[Credits n legal stuff\|credits]]. 
In worst case, I'll just delete this repo and stick with offline version. That's all.

Contributions are welcome, of course. 

And second note: I wanted to release the repo in finished state but I'm just getting tired of editing. Most of job left is to just check if old apps are working and viable. 



Anyway,

enjoy.
