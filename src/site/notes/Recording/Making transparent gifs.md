> a few mods, and a specific recording tool
> mods are as follows :
> greyscreen : hides all fore and middleground elements, makes the background grey
> testing arenas : entity arena is just very useful for containing the scavs
> devconsole : allows for spawning specific scavengers if you wish to, as well as enabling invulnerability
> the recording & editing is all in screentogif 
> procedure :
> make sure your game is running in windowed! fullscreen has anti-aliasing whihc makes it blurry. spawn a scav in a box, via whatever means you see fit. make sure greyscreen is active, then put the recording window over them and hit go. also make sure you're recording at 60fps for better smoothness. once you've got it and you hit stop, it'll open in the editor and you can crop it and the like from there. when you go to save it, check the "enable transparency" box and set the colour to the bg grey. also make sure the encoding is at maximum quality, so that the colours don't flicker

> Recorder is ScreentoGif. Very easy to use, and has a built in function for making one color transparent I also use the mod Grayscreen to gray out the background, making it very easy for ScreenToGif to make it transparent For scav gifs, i poke them until they do something funny, then record them
